# Fiber-optic-chirped-pulse-dispersion
This repository contains a few simulations related to the time dispersion of a chirped pulse when it travels along a fiber cable. It is important to understand the frequency dispersion of a pulse when it travel through a fiber cable because when time dispersion increases, the bit rate must decrease in order to avoid pulse interference and information loss.

This simulation was made taking theoretical reference from the book Fiber-Optic Communication Systems by Govind P. Agrawal.

Please refer to the file **readme.pdf** and the book for a detailed explanation.
